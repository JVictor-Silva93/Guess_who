Guess Who? is a classic fun game for two players.

Each player starts the game with a board that includes cartoon
image of 24 people and their first name with all the images stan-
-ding up. Eachplayer selects a card of their choice from a separ-
-ate pile of cards containing the same 24 images. The objective of 
the game is to be the first to determine which card one's opponent 
has selected. Players alternate asking various yes or no questions 
to eliminate candidates, such as "Does your person wear glasses?" 
The player will then eliminate candidates (based on the opponent's 
response) by flipping those images down until only one is left.


Well-crafted questions allow players to eliminate one or more pos-
-sible cards. Questions might include:

"Does your person wear a hat?"
"Does your person wear glasses?"
"Does your person have a big nose?" etc.
