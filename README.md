# GUESS WHO? - [USER VS. COMPUTER VERSION]

## About
Guess Who? is a classic fun game for two players.

## How To Play ?
Each player starts the game with a board that includes cartoon image of 24 people and their first name with <br> all the images standing up. Each player selects a card of their choice from a separate pile of cards containing the
same 24 images. The object of the game is to be the first to determine which card one's opponent has selected. Players alternate asking various yes or no questions to eliminate candidates, such as "Does your person wear glasses?" The player will then eliminate candidates (based on the opponent's response) by flipping those images down until only one is left. <br><br> Well-crafted questions allow players to eliminate one or more possible cards. <br> Questions might include:

1. *"Does your person wear a hat?"*
2. *"Does your person wear glasses?"*
3. *"Does your person have a big nose?"* **etc.**

This is just a learning project! So we are not supposed to build a GUI version
but a **console** based one. The contributors are advised to pay a visit to the above site once they go through the [How To Play?](#how-to-play) section so that they can have a better understanding of how the game works. Happy learning!
